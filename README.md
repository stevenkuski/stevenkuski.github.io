This is my github page.

Why is this not showing up on the website?

I have a feeling there is a lag from the time i created my website to the time it is visible becuase i putzed around with it for half and hour and then all of a sudden it just worked.

Hello World, I am working on my git hub lab. 

the following is the photo i used for the IOT lab.
